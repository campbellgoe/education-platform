# notes

there are currently two types of user, a student or a teacher, and they can only be one or the other for a given email address.

currently it uses dummy data, i plan to implement the backend and link it to this frontend so that users will be able to create course content and view it.

this is a nextjs project so requires `node` (`nodejs`) v22.x.x and `npm` v10.x.x


first time - `npm i` to install dependencies into node_modules/

`npm run dev` to run local development build (use this to develop)

`npm run build` to build ready for production (fix build errors from here)
